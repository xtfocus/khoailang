# Journal Entry - April 11, 2025

## Backend Updates
- Fixed `/login` endpoint to handle `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data correctly
- Implemented custom exception handler for `RequestValidationError`
- Using email as username for authentication (simplifies user experience)
- Configured bcrypt for password hashing and verification

## Frontend Authentication Implementation
1. **Authentication Context**
- Implemented `AuthContext` for global auth state management
- Added token storage and user profile caching
- Integrated automatic role-based routing

2. **Login Form**
- Created form-encoded login submission
- Added error handling for invalid credentials
- Implemented role-based redirects (admin vs user)

3. **Protected Routes**
- Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component
- Added role-based access control (admin vs user routes)
- Integrated loading states and error boundaries

4. **Admin Interface**
- Created admin dashboard layout
- Added waitlist management interface
- Implemented user management features

5. **Header Component**
- Added dynamic user profile display
- Implemented logout functionality
- Added navigation controls based on user role

## Documentation Updates
- Updated authentication_authorization.md with current bcrypt implementation details
- Added documentation for optional user authentication dependency
- Updated deploy_locally.md with form-encoded login data handling
- Added waitlist system documentation and curl examples
- Updated environment variables section with latest required variables

## Integration Testing Results
Successfully tested the complete authentication flow:
1. User signup through waitlist
2. Admin approval of waitlist entries
3. User login with approved credentials
4. Role-based access to protected routes
5. Admin management of users and waitlist

## Current Authentication Flow
1. Authentication docs now reflect:
   - Direct bcrypt usage instead of passlib
   - Optional user authentication for flexible endpoints
   - Improved password security implementation

2. Deployment guide improvements:
   - Form-encoded data examples for login
   - Updated environment variables list
   - Waitlist system documentation
   - Enhanced API testing section

## Next Steps
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting documentation
- [ ] Document error handling patterns
- [ ] Add more example curl commands for common API operations
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common authentication issues


# Idea for Flashcard Population and Management System

## 1. Word Population Methods

### 1.1 Direct Import
- **Single Word Entry**
  - Manual form input
  - Fields: word, meaning, language
  - Duplicate warning dialog with compare/proceed options
- **Bulk Import**
  - Text file upload
  - Form with multiple or single entry rows (user can click a [+] button to add more words)
  - CSV/Excel import support
  - **Duplicate Handling:**
    - Global "Allow duplicates" checkbox
    - Pre-import summary showing:
      - Total words to import
      - Number of potential duplicates
      - List of duplicate words with existing entries
    - Per-word duplicate controls:
      - Skip/include checkboxes
      - "Skip all duplicates" option
      - "Include all duplicates" option
    - Visual preview of final import list

### 1.2 Intelligent Extraction
- **Document Processing**
  - URL/PDF/Document upload interface
  - Extraction configuration filter: Use natural language query as filter
  - Preview panel showing:
    - Extracted words with context
    - Duplicate indicators (words that already in a flashcard linked to the user)
    - Checkbox for each word (user can select or deselect them)
    - Bulk actions for duplicates

### 1.3 System Suggestions
- **Smart Word Recommendations**: 
  - User types in a prompt expressing what they want to learn
  - Results panel showing:
    - Recommended words
    - Reason for recommendation
    - Duplicate warnings if any
    - Select/deselect options

## 2. Flashcard Management Interface

Let user see flashcard they have access to/is the author

### 2.1 Main Flashcard Table UI
- **Flashcard Table View**
  - Columns:
    - Word (front)
    - Language
    - Creation date
    - Visibility status
    - Actions
  - Filtering options:
    - Show/hide duplicates
    - Group by word
    - Language filter
    - Date range


### 2.2 Duplicate Management
Performed directly in the Flashcard Table UI above
- **Duplicate management option**
  - Do nothing
  - Merge option for combining cards (keep oldest, keep latest, keep longer backtext)
  - Bulk actions for duplicate sets (keep first, keep last)


### 2.4 Catalog Organization

Words in a catalog must be unique. A catalog is like a set of words. Each user can have multiple catalog.

One flashcards can be shown in zero or multiple calatogs.

User later can select which catalogs they want to study.

(So we need to create a catalog table, and flashcard--catalog bridge table)

**Catalog Creation**:
  - Name and description
  - User can 
  - Duplicate handling when user accidentally imports a duplicate to catalog. Must enforce uniqueness of words in a catalog

Catalog can be shared too, just like flashcards.


## 3. User Experience Considerations

### 3.1 Visual Feedback
- Yellow warning badges for duplicates
- Expandable info panels showing duplicate details
- Clear confirmation dialogs
- Toast notifications for duplicate-related actions

### 3.2 User Controls
- Global duplicate preferences in user settings (need to create a table for that too, something like userprofile table, where we save all user specific configuration)
- Batch operations or per-item operations for duplicate management

### 3.3 Error Prevention
- Clear warning messages
- Preview before bulk actions
- Confirmation for irreversible actions

## 4. Smart Quiz Assembly consideration wrt duplicates
  - Never show same word twice in one quiz (flashcards in a quiz must have distinct words)
