# Journal Entry - April 11, 2025

## Backend Updates
- Fixed `/login` endpoint to handle `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data correctly
- Implemented custom exception handler for `RequestValidationError`
- Using email as username for authentication (simplifies user experience)
- Configured bcrypt for password hashing and verification

## Frontend Authentication Implementation
1. **Authentication Context**
- Implemented `AuthContext` for global auth state management
- Added token storage and user profile caching
- Integrated automatic role-based routing

2. **Login Form**
- Created form-encoded login submission
- Added error handling for invalid credentials
- Implemented role-based redirects (admin vs user)

3. **Protected Routes**
- Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component
- Added role-based access control (admin vs user routes)
- Integrated loading states and error boundaries

4. **Admin Interface**
- Created admin dashboard layout
- Added waitlist management interface
- Implemented user management features

5. **Header Component**
- Added dynamic user profile display
- Implemented logout functionality
- Added navigation controls based on user role

## Documentation Updates
- Updated authentication_authorization.md with current bcrypt implementation details
- Added documentation for optional user authentication dependency
- Updated deploy_locally.md with form-encoded login data handling
- Added waitlist system documentation and curl examples
- Updated environment variables section with latest required variables

## Integration Testing Results
Successfully tested the complete authentication flow:
1. User signup through waitlist
2. Admin approval of waitlist entries
3. User login with approved credentials
4. Role-based access to protected routes
5. Admin management of users and waitlist

## Current Authentication Flow
1. Authentication docs now reflect:
   - Direct bcrypt usage instead of passlib
   - Optional user authentication for flexible endpoints
   - Improved password security implementation

2. Deployment guide improvements:
   - Form-encoded data examples for login
   - Updated environment variables list
   - Waitlist system documentation
   - Enhanced API testing section

## Next Steps
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting documentation
- [ ] Document error handling patterns
- [ ] Add more example curl commands for common API operations
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common authentication issues
