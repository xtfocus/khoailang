## What We Solved Today

Today, we addressed an issue with the `/login` endpoint in the backend. The problem was that the endpoint was not handling `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data correctly, which caused errors when using the "Authorize" button in Swagger UI. We updated the `/login` endpoint to use FastAPI's `Form` dependency, allowing it to accept form-encoded data for `username` and `password`. This resolved the issue and ensured compatibility with OAuth2 password flow.

Additionally, we implemented a custom exception handler for `RequestValidationError` to provide more descriptive error messages for 422 errors.

## Backend Setup for Authorization and Authentication

Yes, the backend is now set up for authorization and authentication. The `/login` endpoint is functional, and the necessary dependencies for token generation and validation are in place. The backend is ready to handle user authentication securely.

## Decision: Using Email as Username

We decided to use the `email` field as the `username` for authentication purposes. This simplifies the login process for users, as they are more likely to remember their email addresses than a separate username. Additionally, using email as the unique identifier ensures consistency across the system and avoids potential conflicts with duplicate usernames.

## First User to Log In

The first person to log in should be the administrator or superuser. This user will have the necessary permissions to manage the system and perform initial setup tasks, such as creating other user accounts or configuring the application. In this case, the admin user (e.g., `admin@example.com` with the password `admin123`, if this user exists in the database) should be the first to log in.

## Next Steps: Frontend Integration

We should now move on to creating the frontend for the authentication and authorization system. The frontend should include:
- A login form to collect `username` (email) and `password`.
- Integration with the backend's `/login` endpoint to obtain and store the access token.
- Proper handling of authentication states (e.g., logged-in vs. logged-out).

## Protocol After Deployment

Once the Docker containers are deployed and the database is initialized, the protocol should be as follows:
1. Ensure the backend is running and accessible.
2. Test the `/login` endpoint using tools like Postman or Swagger UI to confirm it works as expected.
3. Develop and test the frontend login functionality.
4. Deploy the frontend and backend together, ensuring they communicate correctly.
5. Perform end-to-end testing to validate the entire authentication flow.

This plan will ensure a smooth transition from backend setup to frontend integration and deployment.
