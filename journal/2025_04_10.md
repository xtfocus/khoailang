# What We Have:

- Frontend based on the Cerego app: This provides a good foundation for user interaction.
- Database supporting multi-users: A solid backend setup is essential for user management.

# To Do:

## Create an Admin Account:

- Initializing the admin account during the first deployment is a good idea. Ensure the admin credentials are securely stored (e.g., environment variables or a secure secrets manager).
- Consider adding functionality to reset the admin password in case it's lost.

## Documentation:

- Documenting how to add users, sign up, and log in is crucial for maintainability and onboarding new developers or admins.
- Ensure the documentation is clear and includes examples or screenshots if possible.

## User Profile:

- Allowing users to view their profile is a good feature. Ensure the profile data is fetched securely and only accessible to the logged-in user.
- Consider adding an option for users to update their profile (e.g., preferred name or email) in the future.

## Login, Sign Up, Remove User:

- These are essential features for user management. Ensure proper validation, error handling, and security measures (e.g., password hashing, rate limiting, etc.).
- For "remove user," decide whether to implement a soft delete (marking the user as inactive) or a hard delete (permanently removing the user from the database).

## Security:

- Use secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2).
- Implement authentication using a library like JWT or OAuth2.


# Fancy
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login.
- Scalability: If you expect the number of users to grow, consider implementing pagination for user management in the admin panel.
- Future-proofing: While focusing on the current features, keep in mind how these will integrate with the flashcards and quizzes later. For example, user roles (admin, regular user) might influence access to certain features.
- Testing: Write unit and integration tests for the login, sign-up, and user management features to ensure reliability. Do this after `#To Do` is done.
- Think in advance how we populate and persist flashcards. And how can we allow on share their flashcards to others (targeted or public)
